this is my first program in OpenCV, the program detect movment in the video camera and recording only when motion detected.
in the second screen that open you can see the diffrent frame - this frame represent the diffrence between two frame 
(frame1 - the previous frame- to frame2 the current frame) if the is diffrence between them (in abs value) the algorithm can 
understand that movment occurred. i use blur and grayscale filters to do this program.
